## Why not just use Powerpoint?

<div class="centered">

</div>

## I already use R for my analyses, can I use it to build slides?

<font size=20> ...Yes you can!</font>

## What if I don't really use R (much)

- <font size=16>It does take a bit of practice</font>
- <font size=16>You'll need to use some CSS code if you like to customize things like fonts and colors</font>
- <font size=16>You'll need to use RMarkdown</font>

## Wait, what is Rmarkdown?
 - Just like a regular R script but allows you to 'knit' a final document to many different formats including:
    - pdf 
    - word
    - html
    - and slides! 
 - You write in a mixture of plain english and code
 - Final doc can include code and output/figures
 
## Let's talk about some of the advantages and disadvantages to creating presentations in R Studio vs. Powerpoint:

## Advantages

- Interactive visualizations
- Include code and code results easily and legibly
- Only requires a browser to open
- The whole thing is reproducible!

![](breakdancing_together.gif)

## You can include animated R figures!!

- Visualization options are only limited by what is possible in R 

```{r, fig.height = 2, fig.width = 2, echo=FALSE}

library(ggplot2)
library(gganimate)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(cyl), mpg)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  # Here comes the gganimate code
  transition_states(
    gear,
    transition_length = 2,
    state_length = 1
  ) +
  enter_fade() + 
  exit_shrink() +
  ease_aes('sine-in-out')

```

## And another!

```{r, out.width = '800px', echo=FALSE}

gapminder <- gapminder

ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, size = pop, colour = country)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +
  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  facet_wrap(~continent) +
  # Here comes the gganimate specific bits
  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', x = 'GDP per capita', y = 'life expectancy') +
  transition_time(year) +
  ease_aes('linear')

```

## You can show code and output! {.smaller}

-  Show show code, show output, or show both!

```{r echo=TRUE}
trial %>% 
  select(-ttdeath, -death, -response, -grade) %>% 
  tbl_summary(by=trt)
```

## Disadvantages

- Takes time to knit slides if complex (~5 minutes)
- Takes time for your changes to be updated in the browser (another 5 minutes)
- Requires some knowledge of R and RStudio to create documents
- Limited slide layout and styling options
- Some HTML/CSS knowledge to control aesthetics
- Somewhat more difficult to edit/collaborate - the “finished” markdown can look confusing before it is knit, as it can contain some raw HTML, R, YAML, and/or CSS code.

## Ok, how do I do it?

**How do I tell R I want to create slides?**

Specify the ioslides_presentation output format in the YAML metadata of your document:

##  What code do I use to separate slides? {.smaller}

![](Slide formats.JPG)

## How do I get my slides onto a web browswer?

1. Sign into GitHub.com [GitHub.com](http://github.com)

**Wait, what is GitHub again?**

GitHub is a place to save your work, keeping track of changes over time. 
You can also make files publicly available via the GitHub website.

## Then what? {.smaller}

<br />

> - Create a new repository in GitHub
> - Go into RStudio and create a new project FROM a GitHub repository
>    - To do this, select: File>New Project>Version Control>Git>paste url from GitHub repository page
- Note: Creating a separate RStudio project for your slides is good practice because it is publicly available

<img src="Git.JPG" align ="middle" style="width:33%">
<img src="Git url.JPG" align ="left" style="width:33%">

## Ok, keep going...
> -  New RMarkdown, select presetation instead of document (choose html ioslides)
> -  Save RMarkdown as "index.html" -- this is important, make sure its lowercase
> -  Push them to GitHub: on the GIT tab in the upper right hand window in Rstudio
>   - Select all files and commit (must commit the index.html, other items are optional)
>   - Select push after commiting
>   - Enter GitHub username and password

## Just a few more steps...

> -  Go to settings in GitHub and scroll down to "GitHub Pages", then change Source None to Master Branch
> -  Copy url above this option "Your site is ready to be published at https://github.com/ahinton-mmc/Slides"
> -  Click edit on main page and put the url link into the Website box, and you can add a Description 

## How do I share and update slides?

> -  Make changes in R then Git commit/push
> -  Same web link should update (but give it some time)
> -  Weblink can be emailed, GitHub page can be shared

## The takeaway:

If your slides are... 

- **simple**, 
  - *you don't care too much about style*, 
  - **you want to show code, figures, and tables...**
  
**Use ioslides!**
